# Gene Sequence Decoder 🧬

A Python tool that converts DNA sequences into mRNA and then translates them into amino acid chains.

## Features
- Converts DNA sequences to mRNA
- Translates mRNA sequences into amino acid chains
- Provides quick visualization of the translation process

## Why I built it
To practice bioinformatics programming and understand the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA → RNA → Protein).

## How it was built
- Python for sequence manipulation and translation
- Uses standard codon tables for accurate translation

## How to use
1. Run `decoder.py`  
2. Input a DNA sequence  
3. Get the corresponding mRNA and amino acid sequence
